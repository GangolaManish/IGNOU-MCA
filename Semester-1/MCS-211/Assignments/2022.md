## Question 1(a). What are the desirable characteristics of an algorithm? Find the GCD of p = 144 and q = 55 using Euclid’s algorithm. 
### (Ref. : Block-1 | Unit-1)

### **Answer**

#### Algorithm
An algorithm is a set of steps to solve a problem or a set of problems. Also, an algorithm is a step by step procedure to solve logical and mathematical or computational problems.

> A reciepe is a good example of algorithm. To cook a dish, a reciepe says what to be done step by step.

##### Important Characteristics of an Algorithm
1. **Input**: There must be a finite number of inputs for the algorithm.
2. **Output**: There must be some output produced as a result of execution of the algorithm.
3. **Definiteness**: There must be a definite sequence of operations for transformation of input into output.
4. **Effectiveness**: Every step of the algorithm should be basic and essential
5. **Finiteness**: The transformation of input to output must be achieved in finite steps.

##### Desirable Characteristics of an Algorithm
1. **General**: The algorithm should be general and is able to solve several cases.
2. **Efficiency**: The algorithm should use resources efficiently, i.e. takes less time and money in producing the result.
3. **Understandability**: The algorithms should be understandable and apply it to own problem.
4. **Uniqueness**: The algorithm should follow uniqueness such that instruction of the algorithm is unambiguous (synonyms : precise/absolute) and clear.

#### Euclid’s Algorithm
##### Pseudo Code:
```plaintext
// p and q are two positive numbers where p is the dividend and q is the divisor.
1. If q = 0, return p and exit.
2. Else, go to step 3.
3. Divide p by q and assign the remainder to r.
4. Assign the value of q to p and the value of r to q.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until q = 0.
```

##### Euclid's algorithm impementation
```
begin [start of the algorithm]
{
    while (q != 0)
    {
        r <- p mod q
        p <- q
        q <- r
    } [end of while loop]
    return (q)
} [end of the algorithm]

## Question 1(b). Differentiate between Greedy Technique and Dynamic Programming approach of problem solving. Name few problems which are solved using these techniques.
### (Ref. : Block-1 | Unit-1)

### **Answer**
#### Comparison Between Greedy Technique and Dynamic Programming

| **Aspect**           | **Greedy Technique**                                                                                          | **Dynamic Programming**                                                                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach**         | Picks the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping it leads to the global optimum.                        | Solves problems by dividing them into smaller sub-problems, solving each, storing results, and combining them. |
| **Objective**        | Focuses on making the best immediate choice without considering future consequences.                         | Considers all possible solutions to ensure the global optimum by solving all sub-problems systematically.   |
| **Optimal Solution** | May not always produce the global optimal solution.                                                         | Always guarantees the global optimal solution if applicable to the problem.                                |
| **Complexity**       | Generally simpler and faster to design and implement.                                                       | Requires more computation and memory due to storing results of sub-problems (memoization or tabulation).   |
| **Reusability**      | Does not store results; decisions are independent at each step.                                             | Stores results of solved sub-problems to avoid redundant calculations.                                     |

## Question 2(a). Prove that, for all positive integers n, 1 + 2 + 4 + ⋯ + n<sup>2</sup> = 2<sup>n+1</sup> - 1
### (Ref. : Block-1 | Unit-2)

### **Answer**

We show, for all positive integers n, that  
1 + 2 + 4 + ⋯ + n<sup>2</sup> = 2<sup>n+1</sup> - 1  

We can rewrite this as,  
2<sup>0</sup>+2<sup>1</sup>+2<sup>2</sup>+...+2<sup>n</sup> = 2<sup>n+1</sup>-1

#### Induction Base:
For n = 1,  
2<sup>0</sup>+2<sup>1</sup> = 2<sup>1+1</sup>-1  
1+2 = 2<sup>2</sup>-1  
3 = 4-1  
3 = 3

#### Induction Hypothesis:
Assume, for an arbitrary positive integer n, that  
2<sup>0</sup>+2<sup>1</sup>+2<sup>2</sup>+...+2<sup>n</sup> = 2<sup>n+1</sup>-1     ..... eq. (i)

#### Induction Step:
We need to show that  
2<sup>0</sup>+2<sup>1</sup>+2<sup>2</sup>+...+2<sup>n</sup>+2<sup>n+1</sup> = 2<sup>(n+1)+1</sup>-1

On L.H.S., we have,  
2<sup>0</sup>+2<sup>1</sup>+2<sup>2</sup>+...+2<sup>n</sup>+2<sup>n+1</sup>  
From eq. (i), we have  
2<sup>n+1</sup>-1+2<sup>n+1</sup>  
2(2<sup>n+1</sup>)-1  
2<sup>(n+1)+1</sup>-1
= R.H.S.

Hence, by the principle of mathematical induction, its prooved that the hypothesis is true for all positive numbers, n.

## Question 2(b). What are asymptotic notations? Explain the significance of Big- O, Omega (Ω) and Theta (Θ) notations with suitable example.
### (Ref. : Block-1 | Unit-2)

### Answer

> To analyze the algorithms efficiency, asymptotic notations are generally used.  
> There are three popular asymptotic notations, Big O, Big Omega (Ω) and Big Theta (Θ).  
> Big O notation is mostly used as it measure the upper bound of the complexity. On the contrary, Big Omega (Ω) measures the lower bound of time complexity, and Big Theta (Θ) is used to measure the average time of any algorithm.

#### Asymptotic Analysis
Asymptotic analysis is a more formal method for analyzing algorithmic efficiency. It is a mathematical tool to analyze the time and space complexity of an algorithm as a function of input size. 

There are three popular asymptotic notations :
1. Big-O notation
2. Big-Ω (Omega) notation
3. Big-Θ (Theta) notation

##### Big-O notation
Big-O is used to measure the upper bound or worst case for time (or space) complexity of an algorithm. It ensures that the algorithm will not exceed this bound.

##### Big-Ω (Omega) notation
Big-Ω (Omega) describes the asymptotic lower bound or best case for time (or space) of an algorithm. Generally, we can say that an algorithm takes at least this amount of time without mentioning the upper bound.

##### Big-Θ (Theta) notation
Big-Θ represents the tight bound or average case for time (or space) of an algorithm. by combining the upper (𝑂) and lower (Ω) bounds. It describes the exact (or average) asymptotic behavior.

##### Summary Table for Common Growth Rates
| Growth Rate |	Notation | Example Algorithms |
|---|---|---|
| Constant | 𝑂(1) | Accessing an array element |
| Logarithmic |	𝑂(log 𝑛) | Binary Search |
| Linear | 𝑂(𝑛) | Linear Search |
| Quadratic | 𝑂(𝑛<sup>2</sup>) | Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort |
| Cubic | 𝑂(𝑛<sup>3</sup> | Matrix Multiplication |
| Exponential | 𝑂(2<sup>𝑛</sup>) | Recursive Fibonacci |

Asymptotic notations allow us to analyze algorithms abstractly, focusing on their scalability and efficiency for large inputs. While Big-O helps identify worst-case scenarios, Big-Omega provides the best-case analysis, and Theta gives a precise understanding of the algorithm's growth behavior.

## Question 3(a). Evaluate p(x) = 3x<sup>4</sup>+2x<sup>3</sup>-5x+7 at x=2 using Horner's rule. Show step wise iterations.
### (Ref. : Block-1 | Unit-3)

### Answer

#### Step-wise iteration for p(x) = 3x<sup>4</sup>+2x<sup>3</sup>-5x+7 at x=2 using Horner's rule

p(x) = 3x<sup>4</sup>+2x<sup>3</sup>-5x+7 at x=2  
We can write as
p(x) = 3x<sup>4</sup>+2x<sup>3</sup>+0x<sup>2</sup>-5x+7 at x=2

array for cofficients, a[5] = {7, -5, 0, 2, 3}
poly = 0

##### Iteration 1
poly = x * poly + a[4]  
poly = 2 * 0 + 3  
poly = 3

##### Iteration 2
poly = x * poly + a[3]  
poly = 2 * 3 + 2  
poly = 8

##### Iteration 1
poly = x * poly + a[2]
poly = 2 * 8 + 0
poly = 16

##### Iteration 1
poly = x * poly + a[1]
poly = 2 * 16 + (-5)
poly = 27

##### Iteration 1
poly = x * poly + a[0]
poly = 2 * 27 + 7
poly = 61

So, the solution for p(x) = 3x<sup>4</sup>+2x<sup>3</sup>-5x+7 at x=2 will be 61.
