## Question 1(a)
### What are the desirable characteristics of an algorithm? Find the GCD of p = 144 and q = 55 using Euclid’s algorithm.

### **Answer**

#### Algorithm
An algorithm is a set of steps to solve a problem or a set of problems. Also, an algorithm is a step by step procedure to solve logical and mathematical or computational problems.

*A reciepe is a good example of algorithm. To cook a dish, a reciepe says what to be done step by step.*

##### Important Characteristics of an Algorithm
1. **Input**: There must be a finite number of inputs for the algorithm.
2. **Output**: There must be some output produced as a result of execution of the algorithm.
3. **Definiteness**: There must be a definite sequence of operations for transformation of input into output.
4. **Effectiveness**: Every step of the algorithm should be basic and essential
5. **Finiteness**: The transformation of input to output must be achieved in finite steps.

##### Desirable Characteristics of an Algorithm
1. **General**: The algorithm should be general and is able to solve several cases.
2. **Efficiency**: The algorithm should use resources efficiently, i.e. takes less time and money in producing the result.
3. **Understandability**: The algorithms should be understandable and apply it to own problem.
4. **Uniqueness**: The algorithm should follow uniqueness such that instruction of the algorithm is unambiguous (synonyms : precise/absolute) and clear.

#### GCD of p = 144 and q = 55 using Euclid’s Algorithm
##### Pseudo Code:
```plaintext
// p and q are two positive numbers where p is the dividend and q is the divisor.
1. If q = 0, return p and exit.
2. Else, go to step 3.
3. Divide p by q and assign the remainder to r.
4. Assign the value of q to p and the value of r to q.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until q = 0.
```

##### Euclid's algorithm impementation
```
begin [start of the algorithm]
{
    while (q != 0)
    {
        r <- p mod q
        p <- q
        q <- r
    } [end of while loop]
    return (q)
} [end of the algorithm]

### Question 1(b): Differentiate between Greedy Technique and Dynamic Programming approach of problem solving. Name few problems which are solved using these techniques.
### **Answer**
#### Comparison Between Greedy Technique and Dynamic Programming

| **Aspect**           | **Greedy Technique**                                                                                          | **Dynamic Programming**                                                                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach**         | Picks the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping it leads to the global optimum.                        | Solves problems by dividing them into smaller sub-problems, solving each, storing results, and combining them. |
| **Objective**        | Focuses on making the best immediate choice without considering future consequences.                         | Considers all possible solutions to ensure the global optimum by solving all sub-problems systematically.   |
| **Optimal Solution** | May not always produce the global optimal solution.                                                         | Always guarantees the global optimal solution if applicable to the problem.                                |
| **Complexity**       | Generally simpler and faster to design and implement.                                                       | Requires more computation and memory due to storing results of sub-problems (memoization or tabulation).   |
| **Reusability**      | Does not store results; decisions are independent at each step.                                             | Stores results of solved sub-problems to avoid redundant calculations.                                     |
