## Question 1(a) Develop an efficient algorithm to find a list of prime numbers from 100 to 1000.

## Question 1(b) Differentiate between Polynomial-time and exponential-time algorithms. Give an example of one problem each for these two running times.

## Question 1(c) Using Horner's rule, evaluate the polynomial p(x)= 2x<sup>5</sup>-5x<sup>4</sup>-3x<sup>2</sup>+15 at x=2. Analyse the computation time required for polynomial evaluation using Horner’s rule against the Brute force method.

## Question 1(d) State and explain the theorems for computing the bounds O, Ω and Theta Θ. Apply these theorem to find the O-notation, Ω-notation and Θ-notation for the function: 𝑓(𝑛)= 10𝑛<sup>3</sup>+18𝑛<sup>2</sup>+1

## Question 1(e) Explain binary exponentiation for computing the value 519. Write the right-toleft binary exponentiation algorithm and show its working for the exponentiation 519. Also, find the worst-case complexity of this algorithm.

## Question 1(f) Write and explain the linear search algorithm and discuss its best and worstcase time complexity. Show the working of the linear search algorithm for the data: 12, 11, 3, 9, 15, 20, 18, 19, 13, 8, 2, 1, 16.

## Question 1(g) What is a recurrence relation? Solve the following recurrence relations using the Master’s method 
### a. 𝑇(𝑛) = 8𝑇(𝑛/2) + 𝑛<sup>2</sup>
### b. 𝑇(𝑛) = 𝑇(3𝑛/4) + 1
