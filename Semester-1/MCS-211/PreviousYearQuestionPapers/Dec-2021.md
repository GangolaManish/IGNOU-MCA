## Question 1(a) Write a mathematical definition of O(big oh). Assume that the function f(n) = 2n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 1. Show that f(n) = O(n<sup>2</sup>). 

### Answer

#### Big-O notation : Upper Bounds

(maximum number of steps to solve a problem)  
Big-O is used to represent the upper bound or worst case of an algorithm. It notifies that a particular algorithm will never go beyond a specific time for every input n. One more advantage of big-O notation that is, it makes algorithms much easier to analyse, since we can conviently ignore low-order terms.

We want to prove that there exist positive constants C and n<sub>0</sub>, such that  
    0 <= f(n) <= C.n<sup>2</sup> for all n >= n<sub>0</sub>

f(n) = 2n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 1  

The function is still a quadratic equation, and can be written as :  

2n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 1  <= 2n<sup>2</sup> + 3n<sup>2</sup> + 1n<sup>2</sup>  
2n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 1  <= (2 + 3 + 1)n<sup>2</sup>  
2n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 1  <= 7n<sup>2</sup>  
2n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 1  = O(n<sup>2</sup>)

Hence proved, that f(n) = 2n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 1 is of O(n<sup>2</sup>).
